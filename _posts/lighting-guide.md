Every type of houseplant is unique, and the light they require is no different. Some prefer bright, direct light (succulents), while others can tolerate less (Pothos). However, just because the plant is labeled “low-light,” doesn’t mean that it will do its best in the corner of a dark room. Generally speaking, more light will  generate more leaves, larger leaves, and smaller gaps between leaf nodes. With every generalization come exceptions—make sure you adapt each plant to a new environment. Don’t take a pothos from a dark room and put it directly in front of a south facing window. The leaves will burn, it will dry out much faster, and the plant will suffer.

Houseplants are typically labeled with their light preference:

- Bright, indirect light: Bright, indirect light can be found in rooms with south, east, or west facing windows. Usually the sun will shine in for at least 4 hours during the day, creating a pretty clear shadow of leaves. In south facing windows that receive light for 6+ hours of the day, you may need to introduce a sheer curtain to prevent the leaves from burning.

- Medium light: Medium light is typically found in rooms with east or west facing windows, but further from the window itself. It could be along the back wall, or on the same wall as the window (where no rays hit the plant). Shadows will be visible, but blurry.

- Low light: Low light conditions are usually found in the corners of rooms far away from windows, or in rooms with only northward facing windows. Leaf shadows will be very blurry and weak, but still present. Low light does *not* mean in rooms without windows or where the blinds are drawn all day. A good rule of thumb: if you can’t read a book comfortably without turning on a light, it’s too dark for a plant.

If you find yourself struggling to find a spot that receives enough light, feat not! You can always purchase a grow light that will help supplement the natural light your plant needs to grow.
