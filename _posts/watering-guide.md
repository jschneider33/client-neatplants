Watering houseplants can very quickly become a pain source for plant owners. Without a routine, it’s easy to forget a plant or two and the next thing you know you have droopy, yellow leaves and a sense of guilt. Luckily, there are a several ways to detect if your plant needs some water. 

Knowing what plant you’re dealing with and its tolerance to water is the first step to nailing your watering schedule. Some, such as lucky bamboo or hydroponically grown plants usually spend their life sitting in water. Others, like succulents, prefer to sit in dried out soil for a few days before receiving more water. 

Next, throw away your watering calendar. I have yet to care for a plant that requires watering on an exact three day interval. Reminders are recommended, but check the plant before you pour more water on it. How do you check? Here are some ways I measure if it’s time to water: 

-	Lift up the pot: For small and medium sized plants, the first thing I do is lift up the pot. If it feels suspiciously light, then most of the soil has probably dried out and it could be time for water. For new plants this can be a little tough because you don’t have a baseline for light or heavy, but give it a few days and you’ll slowly learn how heavy each plant should be.
-	Use your fingers: Use a finger or two and dig into the soil a few inches (depending how big the pot it). If the soil is wet (clumps together and sticks to your fingers) then check back tomorrow. If your finger comes out dusted with dirt, then give it some water! 
-	Check the leaves: A lot of houseplants will get droopy leaves and weak stems when they’re low on water. If you look at your plant and it looks “sad” then it’s time for some more water. For plants with firm leaves (pothos for example), you can also check with the “taco test”—try folding the sides of the leaf gently together, if its flimsy and flexible, might be time for water. 
-	Feel the pot: Touch the outside of the pot, if it’s surprisingly cold to the touch there is still moisture in the soil. The pot will absorb some of the soil and it’ll evaporate from the side of the pot making it cold to the touch. Do note that this will only work for terracotta pots that haven’t been glazed over. 

Unfortunately there isn’t a “one size fits all” when it comes to watering plants. However, as you care for your plants for a few weeks, you will quickly learn your plants better and know which ones need to be watered when. Happy watering!
